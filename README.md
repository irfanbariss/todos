# TODOS

# Actions Taken in the Todo App


* Created a basic Todo application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

* Implemented a loading animation using @keyframes and ensured it lasts for 2 seconds on load using setTimeout().

* Provided functionality to add and remove Todos using functions and event listeners.

* Stored the added Todos in local storage, preserving records even when the page is refreshed.
